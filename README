Some parts of a Rails app can be optimized by rewriting them as a Lua modules that run directly inside Nginx, bypassing Rack and Rails completely. This task is made easier by using OpenResty, Lapis and Moonscript. OpenResty provides a ready-to-use set of Nginx modules, Lapis provides the Lua framework and Moonscript provides the CoffeeScript-like language that should be somewhat familiar to Rails programmers.

What's inside

Setting up on local: INSTALL-OSX.md
Seeting up on Engine Yard: INSTALL-ENGINEYARD.md
Setting up the Lapis app: LAPIS-walkthrough.md
Skeletop Rails app used for testing: https://github.com/radamanthus/lapis-rails
Lapis app: lapis/

TL;DR

Lapis model vs. Rails ActiveRecord on local:

ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:8080/games/1
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:9000/games/1

Lapis: 256.29 requests/sec
Rails: 104.72 req/sec

On EngineYard, performance is about the same. See RESULTS.md.
